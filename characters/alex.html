<h2>About</h2>

Alex is a private detective with the ability to interact with the hidden world of the supernatural. He works for the witch <a href="sylvia.html">Sylvia</a>, tracking down those who have defaulted on magical artifacts she sold them.

<h2>Personality</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Intelligent, Observant, Sarcastic</span><br>
His sarcastic sense of humor and keen observation make him an ideal character to point out and comment on the absurdity of the world around him. He fancies himself a cool, debonaire ladie's man, but somehow always manages to embarrass himself. While he tries to act cool and disinterested most of the time, he actually has a good heart and will eventually do the right thing, even if it is begrudgingly.
