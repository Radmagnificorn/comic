<h2>About</h2>

Ghost loaf is the familiar of Sylvia's apprentice

<h2>Personality</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Crazy</span><br>
Ghost Loaf is nuts. Most of what he says makes very little sense since his brain is swiss cheese on account of the syphilis.

<h2>Story</h2>
<h3>Backstory</h3>
In life Ghost Loaf was a baker in a 17th century French provencial castle. One day due to the selfishness of the lord of the castle, the castle staff were all cursed to live as antropomorphic objects thematically related to their jobs. While the curse was eventually lifted, Ghost Loaf unfortunately died in bread form from a case of syphilis he had contracted before the curse. Later Sylvia's apprentice Molly summoned his spirit to serve as a familiar.
