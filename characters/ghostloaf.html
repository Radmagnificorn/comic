<h2>About</h2>

Ghost Loaf is Antoinette's familiar. Antoinette was supposed to summon a noble familiar spirit and channel it into the body of a falcon. Unfortunately that noble spirit was pushed aside at the last moment by a recently escaped (and spirit world's most wanted) theif who saw a chance to have a new life as a familiar. It didn't work out so well for him though... During the summoning ceremony Antoinette fell into a shelf which scarred off the falcon host, and knocked a loaf of bread into the summoning circle at the exact moment the familiar spirit appeared. Because a loaf of bread can't support a soul, after a few moments of intense agony, the familiar died. Because the covenant of the familiar still needs to be fulfilled, this counts as unfinished business, thus the familiar immediately came back as a ghostly loaf of bread.

<h2>Personality</h2>

Ghost Loaf is nuts. Most of what he says makes very little sense since his brain is swiss cheese on account of the syphilis.
