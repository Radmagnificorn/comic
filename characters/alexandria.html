<h2>About</h2>

Alexandria is a recent graduate from the North American Witch Academy. She is doing her customary post graduate witch internship with the renowned witch <a href="sylvia.html">Sylvia</a>. Because there was already an Alex working at the shop, the gang calls her Marc (a shortened version of her middle name) at Sylvia's instruction. Alexandria has a strong sense of justice, and wants to use her powers for good. However, these values start slowly eroding the more time she spends around Sylvia and her circle.

<h2>Personality</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Intelligent, Just, Optimistic, Rule Follower, Energetic</span><br>
