<h2>About</h2>

Antoinette is a recent graduate from the International Witch Academy. She is doing her customary post graduate witch internship with the renowned witch (who is also her aunt) <a href="sylvia.html">Sylvia</a>. Despite the fact that Sylvia is supposed to be training her, she usually sends Antoinette off to help Alex with his repo work. Because Alex's last name is Mack, and Antoinette's last name is a type of cheese, Sylvia typically reffers to the two of them as "Mack" and "Cheese" respectivly. Even though Antoinette hates the name Cheese, everyone calls her that now, so she's stuck with it. Antoinette has a strong sense of justice, and wants to use her powers for good. However, these values start to slowly erode as Sylvia regularly pushes her into morally gray situations.
